I am a data scientist with over a year of experience in utilizing statistical methodologies to effectively solve ranging business questions. I hold a BA in Statistics from UC Berkeley (Dec '19) with a concentration in machine learning. I currently live in San Francisco and love exploring all the places the Bay Area has to offer.
